Module: rh/Cert/KxiWhitney_RvM.lean
Status: BLOCKED on `annular_balayage_L2` (see file `rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean`)

This module records (1) a clean VK-type zero-density predicate and its
translation to annulus counts, and (2) the final Whitney–Carleson `Kξ` bound,
*assuming* the `annular_balayage_L2` lemma from `CRGreenOuter`.

No axioms, no `sorry`. All missing pieces are marked with a single `BLOCKER:`
line and supplied with precise auxiliary statements.

## 1) ZeroCountAPI and VK → annulus counts

We wrap a short-interval zero-count in a minimal record:

```
structure ZeroCountAPI where
  N : ℝ → ℝ → ℕ
  mono_in_R : ∀ T R₁ R₂, 0 ≤ R₁ → R₁ ≤ R₂ → N T R₁ ≤ N T R₂
  -- counts zeros with |γ - T| ≤ R in the half-plane used after Blaschke neutralization
```

A VK-type predicate at box scale `L = c / log⟨T⟩`:

```
def VK_bound (α : ℝ) (Z : ZeroCountAPI) : Prop :=
  ∃ a₁ a₂ : ℝ, 0 ≤ a₁ ∧ 0 ≤ a₂ ∧
  ∀ T R, R ≥ L → R ≤ α * L →
    (Z.N T R : ℝ) ≤ a₁ * R * log ⟨T⟩ + a₂ * log ⟨T⟩
```

**Combinatorial translation (what we use):**

BLOCKER: `annulus_counts_of_VK`
> From `VK_bound α Z` derive, for every `k ≥ 1`, the annulus estimate
> ```
> ν_k ≤ a₁(α) * (2^k * L) * log⟨T⟩ + a₂(α) * 2^{-k} * log⟨T⟩,
> ```
> i.e. the residual `log⟨T⟩` term picks up an *extra* `2^{-k}` from dyadic
> telescoping on `N(T, ·)` over `[2^k L, 2^{k+1} L]`. This is the minimum
> k‑decay needed so that `∑_k 4^{-k} ν_k` is `O(L log⟨T⟩)`, hence `O(1)` after
> substituting `L = c / log⟨T⟩`.
>
> (A slightly weaker but sufficient alternative is to restrict `k` to
> `k ≥ k₀(α)` after Blaschke neutralization of a fixed dilate, which gives the
> same conclusion.)

## 2) Final Whitney–Carleson bound for ξ (Cert interface)

Assuming `annular_balayage_L2` and `annulus_counts_of_VK` as above, we sum over
annuli to get
```
∬_{Q(α,I)} |∇Uξ|^2 σ dt dσ ≤ Cξ(α,c) * |I|
```
with
```
Cξ(α,c) := C_α * ( (a₁(α)/7) * c + (a₂(α)/15) * c ),
```
because `∑_{k≥1} 4^{-k} 2^k = 1/7` and `∑_{k≥1} 4^{-k} 2^{-k} = 1/15`.

This certifies a *nontrivial* witness for `Kξ` that depends only on `(α,c)`.

### What remains to formalize in mathlib
- `annular_balayage_L2` (analytic; see CRGreenOuter).
- `annulus_counts_of_VK` (combinatorial telescope over `N(T,·)`).

Once those are in place, the Lean theorem is straightforward:

```
theorem kxi_whitney_carleson_of_rvm (α c : ℝ) :
  RH.Cert.KxiWhitney.KxiBound α c
```

and the adapter yields `C_box^{(ζ)} = K0 + Kξ`.
