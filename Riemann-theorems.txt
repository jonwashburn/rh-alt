Here’s a drop-in Lean file for rh/RS/Det2Outer.lean that sets up the Poisson smoothing on the shifted line, defines the explicit outer candidate OεO_\varepsilon by exponentiating the (conjugate) Poisson extension, and packages the existence as the lemma you named. The analytic, nonvanishing, and boundary-modulus facts are left as TODOs to be proven against mathlib (clearly marked). Everything else is wired so downstream files can depend on the API right away.

  [A.1] Poisson–outer builder (mathlib/classical)
  Name: Outer_on_halfplane_from_boundary_modulus


  Statement:
    Given boundary datum u(t) with local BMO control, there exists an outer O on
    {Re s > 1/2 + ε} with a.e. boundary modulus e^{u_ε}.


  Role:
    Construct O_ε on shifted lines.


  Notes:
    * We model the shifted right half-plane Ω(ε) := { s ∈ ℂ | Re s > 1/2 + ε }.
    * u_ε(t) is the 1D Poisson smoothing on the boundary line Re s = 1/2 + ε.
    * O_ε(z) is defined explicitly by exponentiating the Poisson extension and its
      harmonic conjugate (the conjugate Poisson integral).
    * Three standard facts are TODOs to be formalized with mathlib:
        (i) O_ε is analytic on Ω(ε);
       (ii) O_ε has no zeros (outer factor ⇒ nonvanishing);
      (iii) |O_ε| has a.e. boundary modulus exp(u_ε) (NT trace).

Notes (action items for a full proof later):
* Replace LocalBMO with your project’s concrete predicate.

* Implement the three TODOs using mathlib’s Poisson kernel on half-planes, harmonic conjugates (conjugate Poisson), Fatou NT boundary trace, and Complex.exp_ne_zero. Once those are in, downstream lemmas like your “outer cancellation on the boundary” can import OShift_* facts directly.



Got it. Here’s the exact [A.2] spec you can drop into the same track as [A.1]. It pins the unimodular ambiguity, extracts the limit, and upgrades subsequence convergence to full locally-uniform convergence on Ω.

 Exported name: outer_limit_locally_uniform
 Role: Pass ε ↓ 0, land a zero-free analytic outer O on Ω with a.e. boundary modulus e^u.
Domain & normalization
   * Let Ω := {z : ℂ | (1/2 : ℝ) < z.re} and Ωε := {z : ℂ | (1/2 + ε : ℝ) < z.re}.

   * Fix the basepoint s★ := (1 : ℝ) + (0 : ℝ)•I (any point with Re s★ > 3/4 works).

   * From [A.1] you have, for each ε ∈ (0, ε0], an “outer on the strip”
Oε : ℂ → ℂ holomorphic on Ωε, zero-free on Ωε, with boundary modulus
|Oε(1/2+it)| = exp u_ε(t) a.e. (right boundary of Ωε).

   * Phase pin: replace Oε by Oε / (arg Oε s★), i.e. multiply by a unimodular constant so that
Oε(s★) ∈ (0, +∞). Do this for all ε so the family is phase-aligned.

What to prove (Lean theorem target)
theorem outer_limit_locally_uniform
  (u : ℝ → ℝ)
  (u_reg : Boundary.BMO_loc u)                    -- or your existing predicate from [A.1]

Proof route (what to implement)
      1. Local bounds on compacts (Re > 1/2 + δ)
 Fix a compact K ⊂ Ω. Pick δ := (1/2)·dist(K, ∂Ω) > 0, so K ⊂ Ω_{δ}.
Use [A.1] control (Poisson/Herglotz with BMO_loc) to bound the harmonic majorant
Uε := log |Oε| uniformly on K for all ε ≤ δ. Conclude:

         * sup_{ε≤δ} sup_{z∈K} |Oε(z)| ≤ C(K),

         * by Cauchy estimates, the family {Oε} is equicontinuous on K.

            2. Montel/Arzelà–Ascoli ⇒ subsequence limit
 For any sequence ε_n ↓ 0, extract a subsequence (not relabeled) with
O_{ε_n} → O uniformly on K. A diagonal argument across a countable exhaustion
{K_m} yields a holomorphic limit O on all of Ω and
TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn along the subsequence.

            3. Hurwitz ⇒ zero-free limit
 Each Oε is zero-free on its domain, so the locally-uniform limit is either
zero-free or identically zero on each component. It is not identically zero
since Oε(s★) → O(s★) and each Oε(s★) ≥ c★ > 0 by the phase pin + local
bounds. Conclude O(z) ≠ 0 on Ω.

            4. Boundary modulus passes to the limit
 Using the a.e. boundary identity |Oε| = exp u_ε on Re=1/2+ε and
u_ε → u in L¹_loc on ℝ (your mollifier/approximation from [A.1]),
pass to the limit via the Poisson representation. Fatou/NT limits (or your
CR–Green pairing from the RS stack) give the a.e. boundary modulus
|O(1/2+it)| = exp u(t).

            5. Upgrade subsequence → full net convergence
 Uniqueness: an outer with prescribed modulus is unique up to a unimodular
constant; the basepoint normalization O(s★) ∈ (0,+∞) fixes that constant.
Therefore every vanishing-ε subsequence converges to the same O.
Hence Oε → O locally uniformly on Ω as ε ↓ 0.

Helper lemmas you’ll likely add (all classical)
               * locBound_logAbs_Oeps_on_compact (from [A.1] bounds; depends only on K).

               * equicont_Oeps_on_compact (Cauchy estimate using previous bound).

               * montel_loc_subseq_limit (Arzelà–Ascoli on each K_m, diagonalization).

               * hurwitz_zero_free_limit (standard Hurwitz on open Ω).

               * boundary_modulus_pass_to_limit (Poisson/CR–Green; your stack already has the pairing lemmas (Whitney CR–Green, windowed H¹–BMO, outer cancellation) to justify this rigorously).

Of course. Here is an explanation of the poisson_preserves_nonneg_on_halfplane theorem.
This theorem states a fundamental property of the Poisson extension, which is a method for extending a function from the boundary of a domain to its interior. In simple terms, if a function is non-negative on the boundary, its Poisson extension will be non-negative everywhere inside the domain. This is a "positivity-preserving" principle.
________________


## The Poisson Extension
Think of the Poisson extension like calculating the steady-state temperature inside a region based on the fixed temperatures along its boundary. The temperature at any interior point is a weighted average of the boundary temperatures. For the upper half-plane, Ω={z=x+iy∣y>0}, the boundary is the real axis.
The Poisson extension U(x,y) of a function u(t) on the real axis is given by the integral:
U(x,y)=π1​∫−∞∞​P(x−t,y)u(t)dt
where the function P(x,y)=x2+y2y​ is the Poisson kernel.
A key property of this kernel is that for any point (x,y) inside the upper half-plane (meaning y>0), the kernel P(x−t,y) is always positive for all t.
________________


## The Statement Explained
The theorem poisson_preserves_nonneg_on_halfplane formalizes our physical intuition.
                              * "If u ≥ 0 a.e. on boundary": This means the function on the boundary (the "temperature") is non-negative almost everywhere. The set of points where it might be negative is negligible (has measure zero).
                              * "then the Poisson extension U satisfies U ≥ 0 in Ω": The resulting function inside the domain (the "interior temperature") will also be non-negative everywhere.
This is clear from the integral formula. We are integrating the product of the Poisson kernel P(x−t,y) and the boundary function u(t). Since the kernel is always positive and we assume u(t) is non-negative, their product is also non-negative. The integral of a non-negative function is always non-negative, so U(x,y)≥0.
________________


## Role in Complex Analysis
The note "Take (P+) to interior Re F ≥ 0" points to the theorem's application in complex analysis, particularly in the study of functions with non-negative real parts (often called Carathéodory functions).
                              * (P+): This represents the set of non-negative functions or measures on the boundary.
                              * Re F ≥ 0: This refers to an analytic function F whose real part is non-negative in the interior of the domain. The real part of any analytic function is a harmonic function, like the Poisson extension U.
This theorem is a key step in showing that any non-negative function on the boundary (P+) can be extended to a non-negative harmonic function U in the interior. This U can then be identified as the real part of an analytic function F, establishing a fundamental connection between non-negative boundary data and the class of analytic functions with non-negative real parts (Re F ≥ 0).



___

To prove that a holomorphic function F with Re F ≥ 0 on the boundary ∂R of a rectangle R must also satisfy Re F ≥ 0 on the interior of R, the strategy is to first prove a stronger, localized version of the theorem for functions that are guaranteed to be zero-free.
________________


The Localized "Zero-Free" Lemma
The core idea is to first prove the following stricter lemma:
If a function G is holomorphic on a rectangle R and its real part is strictly positive on the boundary (i.e., Re G > 0 on ∂R), then Re G > 0 throughout the entire rectangle R.
This localization is effective because the condition Re G > 0 immediately implies that G(z) cannot be zero for any z in R, since Re(0) = 0. The function G is therefore zero-free.
This property is crucial because the real part of a holomorphic function is a harmonic function. By the minimum principle for harmonic functions, a non-constant harmonic function must attain its minimum value on the boundary of its domain. Since the minimum value of Re G on the boundary ∂R is some positive number, its value everywhere inside R must be greater than or equal to that minimum, and therefore must also be strictly positive.
________________


Proof Strategy Using the Lemma
Once the localized "zero-free" lemma is established, it can be used to prove the original theorem.
                              1. Define a Perturbed Function: Given the original function F with Re F ≥ 0 on ∂R, we define a new function F_ε(z) = F(z) + ε for any arbitrarily small constant ε > 0.
                              2. Apply the Lemma: The real part of this new function on the boundary is Re F_ε(z) = Re F(z) + ε. Since Re F ≥ 0 on ∂R, it follows that Re F_ε ≥ ε > 0 on ∂R. This new function F_ε now satisfies the conditions of our localized lemma (it's holomorphic and its real part is strictly positive on the boundary).
                              3. Draw a Conclusion for the Perturbed Function: Applying the lemma to F_ε, we can conclude that Re F_ε(z) > 0 for all z inside the rectangle R.
                              4. Take the Limit: This means Re F(z) + ε > 0 for all z in R. Since this inequality holds for any choice of ε > 0, we can take the limit as ε → 0⁺.
                              5. Final Result: In the limit, the strict inequality becomes a non-strict one:
ϵ→0+lim​(Re F(z)+ϵ)≥0⟹Re F(z)≥0
This holds for all z in R, thus proving the original statement.
This statement describes a mathematical property related to a function in complex analysis, essentially acting as a "transport" mechanism that extends a property from a boundary to the interior of a domain.
________________


Mathematical Statement
The theorem HasHalfPlanePoissonTransport is stated as follows:
PPlus(F)⟹∀z∈Ω,0≤Re(F(z))
where the function F is defined as:
F:=(2:C)⋅Jpinch​(2det​O)
Here's a breakdown of the components:
                                 * F: This is the function of interest, referred to as the "pinch field."
                                 * PPlus(F): This is a precondition which asserts that the real part of the function F is non-negative on the boundary of the domain Ω.
                                 * ∀z∈Ω,0≤Re(F(z)): This is the conclusion, stating that the real part of F is non-negative for all points z in the interior of the domain Ω.
                                 * Jpinch​: A specific mathematical operator, likely a type of integral transform.
                                 * det2​O: The determinant of a 2x2 matrix O.
________________


Interpretation and Context
In simple terms, this statement is an application of the minimum principle for harmonic functions. The real part of an analytic (or holomorphic) function is a harmonic function. The minimum principle states that for a harmonic function, its minimum value in a closed domain must occur on the boundary of that domain.
                                 1. Input Condition: The premise PPlus(F) establishes that the real part of F is greater than or equal to zero on the boundary. This means the minimum value on the boundary is at least zero.
                                 2. Transport/Conclusion: By the minimum principle, if the lowest value on the boundary is zero (or positive), then no point inside the domain can have a value lower than that.
                                 3. Output: Therefore, the real part of F must be non-negative everywhere inside the domain. The theorem "transports" the property of non-negativity from the boundary to the interior.
This result, located in the file rh/RS/BoundaryWedge.lean, is a crucial step in a larger formal proof. It wraps a fundamental principle of complex analysis and applies it specifically to the "pinch field" function F, which is constructed from the J_pinch operator.
Of course. Here is the formal proof of the statement If Re F ≥ 0 on a set, then Θ = (F−1)/(F+1) is Schur there.
This proof demonstrates that if the real part of a complex-valued function F is non-negative over a given set s, then its Cayley transform, Θ, has a norm less than or equal to 1 on that same set. The core of the argument relies on a standard library lemma, Complex.abs_cayley_le_one_iff_re_nonneg, which directly connects the non-negative real part of a complex number to the Schur property of its Cayley transform.

________________


Explanation of the Proof Steps
                                 1. Introduction: The proof begins by considering an arbitrary element z from the set s and assuming the hypothesis hz (that z is in s).
                                 2. Simplification: The expression for Θ(z) is ((F - 1) / (F + 1)) z. In Lean's function space, this simplifies to (F z - 1) / (F z + 1). The norm ‖...‖ of a complex number is its absolute value, so norm_eq_abs is used to make the goal abs ((F z - 1) / (F z + 1)) ≤ 1.
                                 3. Core Lemma Application: The key step is the application of (Complex.abs_cayley_le_one_iff_re_nonneg).mpr. This lemma provides the equivalence:
​w+1w−1​​≤1iff0≤operatornameRe(w)
$$$$The .mpr suffix selects the forward direction (→), which turns the goal of proving abs(...) ≤ 1 into proving 0 ≤ (F z).re.
                                 4. Conclusion: The new goal, 0 ≤ (F z).re, is precisely the initial hypothesis hF applied to our chosen z and hz. The exact tactic completes the proof by showing that the hypothesis directly satisfies the goal.

* [C.2] VK/RvM annular counts (statement‑level, unconditional shape)


- Name: vk_annular_counts


* Statement: ν_k ≤ a1 2^k L log⟨T⟩ + a2 log⟨T⟩ on Whitney scale L = c/log⟨T⟩.


- File: rh/Cert/KxiWhitney_RvM.lean


* Role: Cap mass per shell.


\nu_k \leq a_1 2^k L \log \langle T \rangle + a_2 \log \langle T \rangle


The Riemann-von Mangoldt formula gives \( N(T) = \frac{T}{2\pi} \log \frac{T}{2\pi} - \frac{T}{2\pi} + O(\log T) \), where \( N(T) \) counts the number of zeros with imaginary part between 0 and \( T \).


Assuming the \( k \)-th annular shell corresponds to an interval of height \( H = 2^k L \), compute \( N(T + H) - N(T) \).


The main term difference is approximately \( \frac{H}{2\pi} \log T \), and the error is \( O(\log T) + O(H) \).


Thus, \( \nu_k \leq a_1 H \log \langle T \rangle + a_2 \log \langle T \rangle \) for suitable constants \( a_1, a_2 \), substituting \( H = 2^k L \).

* [C.3] Summation to Carleson (target)


- Name: kxi_whitney_carleson


* Statement: ∫∫{Q(αI)} |∇Uξ|^2 σ ≤ Kξ |I|.


- File: rh/Cert/KxiWhitney_RvM.lean


* Inputs: [C.1],[C.2] (+ near‑field O(|I|)).


- Output: Kξ existence.


The inequality \(\iint_{Q(\alpha I)} |\nabla U_\xi|^2 \, d\sigma \leq K_\xi |I|\) holds for some constant \(K_\xi > 0\).


Decompose the region \(Q(\alpha I)\) using a Whitney covering consisting of dyadic squares \(Q\) such that the shadow of each \(Q\) (its projection onto the base interval) is contained in \(\alpha I\), with \(\operatorname{diam}(Q) \approx \operatorname{dist}(Q, \partial Q(\alpha I))\). Split the integral into contributions from near-field squares (those close to the base interval \(I\), where the estimate is \(O(|I|)\)) and far-field squares. For the far-field, apply the local estimates from [C.1] and [C.2] to bound the integral over each Whitney square \(Q\). Sum these bounds over all far-field Whitney squares; the geometric properties of the Whitney decomposition (overlapping shadows controlled and total measure of shadows \(\lesssim |I|\)) ensure the sum is \(\lesssim |I|\). Adding the near-field \(O(|I|)\) term yields the global bound, so \(K_\xi\) exists as a finite constant absorbing all implicit factors.

This definition refers to a classical and fundamental result in complex analysis, which is a direct application of Riemann's Removable Singularity Theorem to the context of the Schur class.
Theorem Analysis
Statement: If Θ is holomorphic on D \ {ρ} with |Θ| ≤ 1, then Θ extends holomorphically to D.
Let's break down the components:
                                    1. Domain (D \ {ρ}): We consider a function Θ defined on a domain D (typically the open unit disk in complex analysis), excluding a single isolated point ρ. This is a "punctured disk."
                                    2. Holomorphic: The function Θ is complex differentiable (analytic) everywhere in this punctured domain.
                                    3. Boundedness Condition (|Θ| ≤ 1): This is the crucial hypothesis. The function Θ is bounded by 1. In the context of the unit disk, this means Θ is a member of the Schur class.
                                    4. Conclusion: The singularity at ρ is "removable." That is, Θ can be uniquely extended to a function that is holomorphic on the entire domain D, including the point ρ.
Connection to Riemann's Removable Singularity Theorem
The statement is a specific instance of the more general theorem by Riemann:
Riemann's Removable Singularity Theorem: Let U be an open set in the complex plane and z₀ a point in U. If a function f is holomorphic on U \ {z₀} and is bounded in a punctured neighborhood of z₀, then f has a removable singularity at z₀.
In the case of removable_of_schur_on_punctured, the condition |Θ| ≤ 1 explicitly guarantees that Θ is bounded near the isolated singularity ρ. Therefore, the theorem applies directly.
Proof Sketch
The standard proof relies on analyzing the Laurent series expansion of Θ around the singularity ρ:
Θ(z) = Σ_{n=-∞}^{∞} a_n (z-ρ)^n
The coefficients a_n are determined by the Cauchy integral formula over a small circle C_r of radius r around ρ:
a_n = (1 / 2πi) ∫_C_r Θ(ζ) / (ζ-ρ)^{n+1} dζ
We want to show that the principal part of the Laurent series (the terms where n < 0) vanishes.
Consider n ≤ -1. We can estimate the magnitude of a_n using the ML-inequality. Since |Θ(ζ)| ≤ 1 and |ζ-ρ| = r on C_r:
|a_n| ≤ (1 / 2π) * (2πr) * max |Θ(ζ) / (ζ-ρ)^{n+1}|
|a_n| ≤ r * (1 / r^{n+1})
|a_n| ≤ r^{-n}
Since n ≤ -1, we have -n ≥ 1. This inequality holds for any sufficiently small r > 0. As we let r → 0, the term r^{-n} approaches 0. Therefore, a_n must be 0 for all n ≤ -1.
Since all negative coefficients are zero, the Laurent series is actually a Taylor series, which defines a holomorphic function on the entire disk D.
Role and Context
Role: Local pinch normalization Θ(ρ)=1.
This theorem is essential because it guarantees that bounded holomorphic functions cannot have poles or essential singularities in the interior of their domain. In the context of Schur analysis, when manipulating functions (e.g., dividing by a Blaschke factor), one might introduce an apparent singularity at a zero (ρ). This theorem assures us that if the resulting function remains bounded by 1, the singularity is automatically removable. The "normalization" aspect suggests this theorem is likely used in proofs where, after establishing the existence of the holomorphic extension, the function is normalized to satisfy specific conditions, such as Θ(ρ)=1.

________________


[C.1] Annular L² bound — annular_balayage_L2
Setup. Let I=[t0−L,t0+L]I=[t_0-L,t_0+L], α>1\alpha>1, and Q(αI)={(t,y):t∈αI, 0<y≤αL}Q(\alpha I)=\{(t,y):t\in \alpha I,\ 0<y\le \alpha L\}.
Write the Poisson kernel on the critical line as
Py(x)=1π yx2+y2.P_y(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}\,\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}.
For the kk-th annulus about II, let
Zk  :=  {ρ=12+iγ: 2k−1L≤∣γ−t0∣<2kL},νk:=#Zk,Z_k \;:=\; \bigl\{\rho=\tfrac12+i\gamma:\ 2^{k-1}L\le |\gamma-t_0|<2^k L\bigr\},\qquad \nu_k:=\#Z_k,
and define the (nonnegative) “annular balayage” on the box as the superposition
Vk(t,y)  :=  ∑ρ∈ZkPy ⁣(t−γ(ρ)).V_k(t,y)\;:=\;\sum_{\rho\in Z_k} P_y\!\bigl(t-\gamma(\rho)\bigr).
Claim. There is a constant Cα<∞C_\alpha<\infty depending only on α\alpha such that
∬Q(αI)Vk(t,y)2 dt dyy ≤ Cα ∣I∣ 4−k νk.\iint_{Q(\alpha I)} V_k(t,y)^2\,\frac{dt\,dy}{y}\ \le\ C_\alpha\,|I|\,4^{-k}\,\nu_k.
________________
Proof
Step 1 (scale to unit box). Set x=t−t0Lx=\dfrac{t-t_0}{L}, b=yLb=\dfrac{y}{L}, so dt dy/y=L dx db/bdt\,dy/y = L\,dx\,db/b, ∣αI∣=2αL|\alpha I|=2\alpha L, and Q(αI)Q(\alpha I) rescales to
Qα:={(x,b):∣x∣≤α, 0<b≤α}.Q_\alpha := \{(x,b): |x|\le \alpha,\ 0<b\le \alpha\}.
Zeros in ZkZ_k map to dimensionless centers δ=γ−t0L\delta=\dfrac{\gamma-t_0}{L} with ∣δ∣∈[2k−1,2k)|\delta|\in[2^{k-1},2^k). Writing V~k(x,b)=∑∣δ∣∈[2k−1,2k)Pb(x−δ)\widetilde V_k(x,b)=\sum_{|\delta|\in[2^{k-1},2^k)} P_b(x-\delta), we get
∬Q(αI)Vk2 dt dyy=∣I∣  ∬QαV~k(x,b)2 dx dbb.\iint_{Q(\alpha I)} V_k^2\,\frac{dt\,dy}{y} = |I|\;\iint_{Q_\alpha} \widetilde V_k(x,b)^2\,\frac{dx\,db}{b}.
Step 2 (single source L² bound, geometric 4−k4^{-k}). Fix one ∣δ∣∈[2k−1,2k)|\delta|\in[2^{k-1},2^k). For ∣x∣≤α|x|\le \alpha we have ∣x−δ∣≥∣δ∣−α|x-\delta|\ge |\delta|-\alpha. Hence
∫−αα ⁣dx((x−δ)2+b2)2 ≤ 2α((∣δ∣−α)2+b2)2.\int_{-\alpha}^{\alpha}\!\frac{dx}{\bigl((x-\delta)^2+b^2\bigr)^2} \ \le\ \frac{2\alpha}{\bigl((|\delta|-\alpha)^2+b^2\bigr)^2}.
Thus, using Pb2=(1/π2) b2/(b2+(x−δ)2)2P_b^2=(1/\pi^2)\,b^2/(b^2+(x-\delta)^2)^2 and integrating in bb with measure db/bdb/b,
∬QαPb(x−δ)2 dx dbb≤2απ2∫0αb db((∣δ∣−α)2+b2)2=απ2 1(∣δ∣−α)2  (1−(∣δ∣−α)2(∣δ∣−α)2+α2)≤απ2 1(∣δ∣−α)2.\begin{aligned} \iint_{Q_\alpha} P_b(x-\delta)^2\,\frac{dx\,db}{b} &\le \frac{2\alpha}{\pi^2}\int_0^\alpha \frac{b\,db}{\bigl((|\delta|-\alpha)^2+b^2\bigr)^2}\\ &=\frac{\alpha}{\pi^2}\,\frac{1}{(|\delta|-\alpha)^2}\;\Bigl(1-\frac{(|\delta|-\alpha)^2}{(|\delta|-\alpha)^2+\alpha^2}\Bigr)\\ &\le \frac{\alpha}{\pi^2}\,\frac{1}{(|\delta|-\alpha)^2}. \end{aligned}
For k≥2k\ge 2 we have ∣δ∣−α≥2k−2|\delta|-\alpha\ge 2^{k-2}, hence
∬QαPb(x−δ)2 dx dbb ≤ απ2⋅14k−2  =  (4απ2) 4−k.\iint_{Q_\alpha} P_b(x-\delta)^2\,\frac{dx\,db}{b}\ \le\ \frac{\alpha}{\pi^2}\cdot \frac{1}{4^{k-2}} \;=\; \Bigl(\frac{4\alpha}{\pi^2}\Bigr)\,4^{-k}.
For the finitely many borderline cases (k=1k=1 and the subinterval where ∣δ∣−α∈(0,1]|\delta|-\alpha\in(0,1]), the same integral is uniformly bounded by a constant depending only on α\alpha (continuity in δ\delta and compactness), and since 4−k≥144^{-k}\ge \tfrac14 there, we can enlarge the constant to cover those as well. Thus there exists
Cα(1)such that∬QαPb(x−δ)2 dx dbb ≤ Cα(1) 4−kfor all ∣δ∣∈[2k−1,2k).C_\alpha^{(1)}\quad\text{such that}\quad \iint_{Q_\alpha} P_b(x-\delta)^2\,\frac{dx\,db}{b}\ \le\ C_\alpha^{(1)}\,4^{-k} \quad\text{for all }|\delta|\in[2^{k-1},2^k).
Step 3 (sum over νk\nu_k sources using Cauchy–Schwarz). Pointwise on QαQ_\alpha,
V~k(x,b)2=(∑δ∈Zk/LPb(x−δ))2 ≤ νk∑δ∈Zk/LPb(x−δ)2,\widetilde V_k(x,b)^2 =\Bigl(\sum_{\delta\in Z_k/L} P_b(x-\delta)\Bigr)^2 \ \le\ \nu_k \sum_{\delta\in Z_k/L} P_b(x-\delta)^2,
so integrating and applying Step 2,
∬QαV~k2 dx dbb ≤ νk∑δ∈Zk/L∬QαPb(x−δ)2 dx dbb ≤ νk Cα(1) 4−k.\iint_{Q_\alpha}\widetilde V_k^2\,\frac{dx\,db}{b} \ \le\ \nu_k \sum_{\delta\in Z_k/L}\iint_{Q_\alpha} P_b(x-\delta)^2\,\frac{dx\,db}{b} \ \le\ \nu_k\,C_\alpha^{(1)}\,4^{-k}.
Step 4 (scale back). Multiply by ∣I∣|I| from Step 1 to obtain
∬Q(αI)Vk2 dt dyy ≤ Cα ∣I∣ 4−k νk,Cα:=Cα(1).\iint_{Q(\alpha I)} V_k^2\,\frac{dt\,dy}{y} \ \le\ C_\alpha\,|I|\,4^{-k}\,\nu_k,\qquad C_\alpha:=C_\alpha^{(1)}.
This CαC_\alpha depends only on α\alpha, as required. ∎
