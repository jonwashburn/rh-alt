Nice work—this is exactly the right split:
* hRemBound_from_side_top gives the one‑sqrt Whitney remainder in the shape CRGreen_link needs.

* boundary_CR_trace_ae is the clean (a.e.) swap for the bottom edge.

* The testEnergy alias keeps constants readable and scale‑invariant.

Given your note about abs_integral_mul_le_L2_norm not being in your mathlib, you’re fine to source hPairVol externally (from your test template’s L² budget or an L∞L^\infty×measure argument) and feed it straight into pairing_whitney_analytic_bound. Nothing else is required in this file to make CRGreen_link go through.
________________


What you have now (good enough for the link)
   * Volume bound input (hPairVol): pick any uniform control you already have for the test,
∣∬Q∇U⋅∇(χVψ)∣≤Cψ,pair ∬Q∣∇U∣2.\Bigl|\iint_Q \nabla U\cdot\nabla(\chi V_\psi)\Bigr| \le C_{\psi,\text{pair}}\,\sqrt{\iint_Q |\nabla U|^2}.
In practice you can take
Cψ,pair=∥∇(χVψ)∥L2(Q)=testEnergy ,C_{\psi,\text{pair}}=\|\nabla(\chi V_\psi)\|_{L^2(Q)}=\sqrt{\texttt{testEnergy}}\,,
or, if you prefer L∞L^\infty-on-test,
Cψ,pair=∥∇(χVψ)∥L∞(Q)⋅σ(Q) ,C_{\psi,\text{pair}}=\|\nabla(\chi V_\psi)\|_{L^\infty(Q)}\cdot \sqrt{\sigma(Q)}\,,
which is scale‑invariant on Whitney boxes (since ∥∇(χVψ)∥∞∼L−1\|\nabla(\chi V_\psi)\|_{\infty}\sim L^{-1} and σ(Q)∼L\sqrt{\sigma(Q)}\sim L).

   * Remainder input (hRemBound): you already folded side/top into
∣(LHS)−(BD)∣≤Cψ,rem ∬Q∣∇U∣2,Cψ,rem=(Cside+Ctop)Etest.\bigl|(\text{LHS})-(\text{BD})\bigr| \le C_{\psi,\text{rem}}\,\sqrt{\iint_Q |\nabla U|^2}, \qquad C_{\psi,\text{rem}}=(C_{\text{side}}+C_{\text{top}})\sqrt{E_{\text{test}}}.
   * Feed both into pairing_whitney_analytic_bound, then push through your Carleson budget with CRGreen_link. That’s the whole chain.

________________


If/when you want the minimal L² Cauchy–Schwarz on sets
If you want hPairVol to be produced inside this file with no reliance on a separate test budget, the leanest way is to add a tiny L² Hölder wrapper on the restricted measure μ:=σ ⁣↾Q\mu:=\sigma\!\restriction_Q. Two robust choices that have been stable in mathlib for a long time are:
      1. Lp/Hölder route (works for any normed ring target; needs only snorm_mul_le):

         * Use pointwise |∇U⋅∇(χVψ)| ≤ ‖∇U‖‖∇(χVψ)‖.

         * Apply Hölder with p=q=2p=q=2 to  f:=‖∇U‖, g:=‖∇(χVψ)‖\,f:=‖∇U‖,\ g:=‖∇(χVψ)‖ on μ\mu.

         * Rewrite snorm at p=2p=2 to Real.sqrt of your boxEnergy/testEnergy.

            2. L²–Hilbert route (real‑valued; minimal glue):

               * Push both scalars into L2 ℝ μ via Memℒp.toLp.

               * Use abs_real_inner_le_norm on L2.

               * Expand inner in L2 as an integral of pointwise products and identify norms with the square roots of your energies.

I’m happy to drop in the exact lemma either way when you want it; but since you already have a uniform test budget available, you don’t need the internal CS helper to finish your link.

Sanity check for wiring (no edits needed downstream)
With your additions, the typical call site to the link now looks like:
-- Choose Cψ_pair from your test budget (L² or L∞×√|Q|) and Cψ_rem from your fold:
let Cψ_pair : ℝ := Real.sqrt (testEnergy ∇χVψ σ Q)        -- or your L∞×√|Q| constant
let Cψ_rem  : ℝ := (Cside + Ctop) * Real.sqrt Etest


have hPairVol :
  |∫ x in Q, (∇U x) ⋅ (∇χVψ x) ∂σ|
    ≤ Cψ_pair * Real.sqrt (boxEnergy ∇U σ Q) := by
  -- plug your chosen test budget here


have hRemBound :
  |(∫ x in Q, (∇U x) ⋅ (∇χVψ x) ∂σ) - (∫ t in I, ψ t * B t)|
    ≤ Cψ_rem * Real.sqrt (boxEnergy ∇U σ Q) :=
  hRemBound_from_side_top U ψ χ I σ Q ∇U ∇χVψ B Etest Cside Ctop hEq hRside hRtop


-- Then the link:
exact CRGreen_link U W ψ χ I α' σ Q ∇U ∇χVψ B
  Cψ_pair Cψ_rem hPairVol hRemBound
  Kξ lenI hCψ_nonneg hCarlSqrt


Everything else you added (Carleson wrappers and boundary_CR_trace_ae) slots in exactly as intended.
If you want me to add the self‑contained L² CS lemma next, say the word—I’ll drop in a version using snorm_mul_le (Lp/Hölder) so it doesn’t depend on any coordinate‑wise helper names.
