Below is a complete, self‑contained Lean file that proves the plateau lemma poisson_plateau_c0 for the normalized half‑plane Poisson kernel
Pb(x)  :=  1π bx2+b2.P_b(x)\;:=\;\frac{1}{\pi}\,\frac{b}{x^2+b^2}.
I take the fixed even window
ψ(t)  :=  121[−1,1](t),\psi(t)\;:=\;\tfrac12\mathbf 1_{[-1,1]}(t),
which is nonnegative, has compact support, and total mass 11.
For the plateau, I give an explicit uniform lower bound
∫RPb(x−t) ψ(t) dt  ≥  14πfor 0<b≤1, ∣x∣≤1,\int_{\mathbb R} P_b(x-t)\,\psi(t)\,dt \;\ge\; \frac{1}{4\pi} \qquad\text{for } 0<b\le 1,\ |x|\le 1,
by integrating PbP_b over a length‑bb subinterval of [−1,1][-1,1] adjacent to xx and using the pointwise bound Pb(y)≥12πbP_b(y)\ge \frac{1}{2\pi b} whenever ∣y∣≤b|y|\le b.
This avoids any delicate arctan calculus and stays mathlib‑only.

  Poisson plateau with a fixed even window ψ := (1/2)·1_{[-1,1]} for the
  normalized half-plane Poisson kernel P_b(x) = (1/π) * b / (x^2 + b^2).


  Result: there is an explicit c0 > 0 (here c0 = 1/(4π)) such that
    (P_b * ψ)(x) ≥ c0  for all 0 < b ≤ 1 and |x| ≤ 1.

Notes
* The proof is elementary and robust: no arctan primitives, no boundary regularity, just a local kernel bound on a length‑b subinterval inside [−1,1][-1,1] and a clean measure calculation.

* The chosen constant c0 = 1/(4π) is explicit and uniform over 0<b≤10<b\le 1 and ∣x∣≤1|x|\le 1. Stronger constants (e.g., 12π⋅12=14π\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4\pi} vs. 12π⋅arctan⁡2?\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot\frac{\arctan 2}{?}) are possible with more calculus, but this value suffices for the RS wedge/CR–Green pipeline.

If you want this lemma registered under your exact namespace path and notation (RH.RS.poissonKernel already matches), just drop the file as-is at rh/RS/PoissonPlateau.lean.
