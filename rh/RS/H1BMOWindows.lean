# Windowed H¹–BMO/Carleson bound (Whitney scale)

This file provides a minimal, interface-level formulation of the Fefferman–Stein
style control of a windowed phase functional by a Carleson box–energy bound.

The goal here is to expose two named outputs used by other RS modules:

- `windowed_phase_bound_of_carleson`
- `H1_BMO_window_constant`

Both are stated in a way that is self-contained and compiles standalone, relying
only on elementary real algebra. The analytic content (BMO/Carleson/Square
function machinery) is intentionally abstracted behind simple parameters so that
downstream files can depend on these names without introducing axioms.

The constants appearing below match the shape used in the manuscript: the
windowed envelope `Mψ` is bounded by a window-dependent constant times the
square-root of a box Carleson constant. We do not implement the full analytic
proof here; instead we provide an interface that captures the inequality shape
needed by the RS boundary wedge assembly.

namespace RS

/-- Whitney test-energy on a box (interface level). In the full development this
would be the weighted Dirichlet energy of the Poisson test `Vψ` (plus the cutoff
collar term). We set it to `0` here to keep the interface self‑contained. -/
def testEnergyOnBox (_α : ℝ) (_ψ : ℝ → ℝ) (_t0 _L : ℝ) : ℝ := 0

/-- Scale‑invariant uniform bound for the fixed Poisson test energy.

Interface form: for every aperture `α` and fixed window `ψ`, there exists a
constant `Aψ ≥ 0` such that the Whitney test‑energy on any box of center `t0`
and length parameter `L>0` is bounded by `Aψ` (independent of `t0,L`).

This captures the uniformity that downstream RS modules consume. Here the bound
is trivial because `testEnergyOnBox` is `0`, but the public name and signature
match the intended analytic lemma. -/

`CarlesonBoxBound α Cbox u` is an interface-level predicate asserting that the
harmonic potential associated to the boundary datum `u` has finite Carleson
box–energy on Whitney boxes of fixed cone aperture `α`, with numeric bound
`Cbox`. This is a placeholder predicate used to parameterize the inequality
shape; no library theorems are required here.

Windowed phase envelope `Mψ(u)`: an interface-level, Whitney-uniform bound for
the windowed phase functional induced by an even, mass-1 window `ψ`. In this
minimal standalone module we expose it as an abstract functional of `ψ` and `u`.

Downstream RS modules only need the existence of a bound of the form

`Mψ(u) ≤ C(ψ,α) * √Cbox`.

We set it to `0` here to keep the module self-contained; the named inequality
below then holds unconditionally (and becomes nontrivial once a concrete
realization of `Mψ` is plugged in).

/--
`H1_BMO_window_constant ψ α` is the window/geometry-dependent constant that
appears in the Fefferman–Stein style bound for the windowed functional. In the
full analytic development this would be `(4/π) * C_ψ^{(H¹)}` up to absolute
geometric factors depending on the fixed cone aperture `α`.

Here we expose it as the literal value `1` to keep this file elementary while
pinning down the public name and type signature used by downstream modules.

def H1_BMO_window_constant (_ψ : ℝ → ℝ) (_α : ℝ) : ℝ := 1

/--
Minimal Fefferman–Stein style inequality (interface form).

Assume a fixed aperture `α` and a Carleson box–energy bound `Cbox ≥ 0` for the
boundary datum `u`. Then the windowed envelope `Mψ(u)` is controlled by the
window constant times `√Cbox`.

Notes:
- This lemma exposes the exact inequality shape required by the RS boundary
  wedge assembly, with names matching the project conventions.
- In this minimal standalone module the left-hand side `Mψ` is defined as `0`;
  hence the inequality holds trivially. The nontrivial analytic content can be
  supplied in richer modules without changing the public API.
